# Hyperspectral_Crop_Analysis
Hyperspectral Imagery of Agricultural Crops Analysis

# data/raw
This directory contains 7k different observations collected by GHISACONUS (Global Hyperspectral Library of Agricultural Crops for Conterminous United States) of multiple different crop types (corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and winter wheat) across several years (2008-2015) in the United States.

# notebooks
This directory contains the notebook used to analyze the data.  Numerous interactive visualizations are created in the notebook by using the Python library plotly.  Unfortunately, these visualizations cannot be rendered with githubs viewer.  Therefore, screenshots of the visualizations have been captured and placed in the directory.  However, to utilize the full interactive features of the displays (such as mouse over popups and drop down menus) they must be run in the notebook.
